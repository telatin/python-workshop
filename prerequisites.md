# Prerequisites


## Essentials

1. **Familiarity with the Linux command line**: we introduced the Linux terminal interface during [Week 1 of the training](https://mmbdtp.github.io/modules/unix/week_1__programme/)
2. **A working notebook on CLIMB-BIG-DATA**: each student has a notebook on [CLIMB-BIG-DATA](https://bryn.climb.ac.uk). We will use a notebook for our training
3. **Install (or update) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** on your MacBook. You can install the extension for Python.
4. **Ensure you have the `git`** command in your MacBook terminal. If you type `git --version` and instead of the version you have an error, type `xcode-select --install` and follow the instructions.
5. **An account on GitHub**: sign up at [github.com](https://github.com/) to have an account on GitHub


## Recommended

1. **Access to Discord**: as we did for the initial training, we can use Discord to quickly share commands, code snippets etc.
2. We will quickly introduce some basic steps of Git and Github. The topic is broad, so you will benefit from watching a [15-minute introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE&t=1s). You don't need to remember the content.
3. Python is even broader, and again, you should at least watch a [10-minute intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWjsdhR3z3c). You don't need to remember the content.

Note: if you have [brew](https://brew.sh/) and [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html) installed in your local terminal, you can have more fun. But we will not need this during the Masterclass.
