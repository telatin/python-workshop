# Prerequisites


## Essentials

1. **Familiarity with the Linux command line**: we introduced the Linux terminal interface during [Week 1 of the training](https://mmbdtp.github.io/modules/unix/week_1__programme/), but without regular practice these skills are easily lost.
2. **A working notebook on CLIMB-BIG-DATA**: each student has a notebook on [CLIMB-BIG-DATA](https://bryn.climb.ac.uk). We will use a notebook for our training
3. **An account on GitHub**: sign up at [github.com](https://github.com/) to have an account on GitHub

## Recommended

1. We will quickly introduce some basics steps of Git and Github. The topic is broad, so you will benefit from watching a [15 minutes introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE&t=1s). You don't need to remember the content.
2. Python is even broader and again, you should at least watch a [10 minutes intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWjsdhR3z3c). You don't need to remember the content.
