# Python Masterclass 

> This document shows an hypotetical programme for a longer masterclass.
> You can use it to study python at your pace, using online resources.

1. **Introduction to Python**

> We covered part of the setup during the masterclass, and you should be ready to study the basic syntax (see  [example](first-steps/01-hello.ipynb) )

   * Overview of Python: History, versions, and uses
   * Setting Up the Environment: Installing Python, using IDEs (PyCharm, VS Code)
   * Basic Syntax: Variables, data types, and basic operations

1. **Control Flow**

> Try examples with simple variables

   * Conditional Statements: if, elif, else
   * Loops: for, while, nested loops
   * Comprehensions: List, dictionary, and set comprehensions

3. **Functions**

> Create simple functions performing simple tasks, like summing numbers

   * Defining Functions: Parameters, return values, and scope
   * Lambda Functions: Anonymous functions
   * Built-in Functions: map, filter, reduce

4. **Data Structures**

   * Lists: Methods, slicing, and comprehensions
   * Tuples: Immutability, packing, and unpacking
   * Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, methods, and comprehensions
   * Sets: Unique elements, methods, and operations

5. **Modules and Packages**

   * Importing Modules: Standard library and third-party modules
   * Creating Packages: Structuring and importing packages

6. **File Handling**

> In bioinformatics several files are very large and we need to read them
> line by line, rather than loading the whle content to memory
 
   * Reading and Writing Files: Text and binary files
   * Context Managers: Using with statement
   * JSON Handling: Reading from and writing to JSON files

7. **Exception Handling**

> Here we go into more advanced topics, but useful when your scripts start to require
> debugging

   * Try-Except Blocks: Catching and handling exceptions
   * Raising Exceptions: Custom exceptions
   * Finally Clause: Cleaning up resources

8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

> See our [example](first-steps/05-object.ipynb)

   * Classes and Objects: Defining classes, creating objects
   * Methods: Instance, class, and static methods
   * Inheritance: Single and multiple inheritance
   * Polymorphism: Method overriding and magic methods
   * Encapsulation: Private and protected members

9.  **Advanced Topics**

> You can probably skip this section at first and go straigh to data analysis

   * Decorators: Function decorators and class decorators
   * Generators: Yield statement, generator expressions
   * Context Managers: Custom context managers using __enter__ and __exit__
   * Concurrency: Threads, multiprocessing, and async programming

10. **Working with Libraries**

> See our [example](first-steps/02-tips.ipynb) 

   * NumPy: Arrays and mathematical functions
   * Pandas: DataFrames, series, and data manipulation
   * Matplotlib: Plotting and visualization
   * BioPython: Working with biological data
   * Requests: HTTP requests for API calls

1.  **Testing and Debugging**

   * Unit Testing: unittest module, writing test cases
   * Debugging: Using pdb, logging, and debugging tools in IDEs

2.  **Best Practices**

   * Code Style: PEP 8 guidelines
   * Documentation: docstrings
   * Version Control: Using Git and GitHub

13. **Real-World Projects in Bioinformatics**

> It's great to assign yourself some tasks. To begin with try to replicate existing programs, so that you can compare your output with theirs. See our [example](project/README.md)

   * Project 1: Analyzing DNA Sequences with BioPython
   * Project 2: Data Analysis of Genomic Data with Pandas
   * Project 3: Creating a Bioinformatics Pipeline
   * Project 4: Visualizing Biological Data with Matplotlib
