# Python notebooks

## What is a Python notebook?

A Python Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used for data analysis, scientific research, machine learning, and educational purposes. Users can run Python code in cells, see the output immediately, and easily document their process, making it a powerful tool for both development and presentation.

The first notebook focuses on the basics of Python, and this is what we cover during the Masterclass.
There are two additional notebooks using powerful libraries for data science, to give an idea of the potential uses.

* [**01-hello**](01-hello.ipynb): the very basics of python
* [02-tips](02-tips.ipynb): data analysis, an example using the tips table
* [03-books](03-books.ipynb): data analysis, an example using the books table
